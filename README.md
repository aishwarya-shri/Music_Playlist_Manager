## 🎧 About the Project  

**Music Playlist Manager** is a simple yet powerful playlist manager built in **C++** using **doubly linked lists**.  
It provides a menu-driven console interface that lets users add, delete, search, and play songs just like a real-world music player — but entirely through data structure logic.  

The project focuses on:
- Practicing **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles.  
- Understanding **pointer manipulation** through linked lists.  
- Implementing **menu-driven user interaction**.
